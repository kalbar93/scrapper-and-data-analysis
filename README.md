# scrapper-and-data-analysis
This is my first project. I wanted to create an application, a bot that would extract data from a classified ads website and save it to an Excel file for later data analysis. I based my code on web scraping in Python using the BeautifulSoup (bs4) and Selenium libraries. For data analysis, I used Jupyter Notebook, and for visualization, Tableau Public. This is still a work in progress project that aims to predict real estate prices based on data through machine learning in the future.
